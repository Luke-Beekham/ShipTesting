# ShipTesting
A game I will make for english

## The Vision
You control a ship in a 2d environment destroying enemys who harm your home planet. 

This game will have a story and maybe a ending if not dev lazy. 

## Current Progress
1. I have figured out the controls for the ship!! You move forward and backward with w/s and turn left/right with a/d.
2. I added a enemy that follows you.  
3. I added Lazers and a Lazer heat value
4. I made the lazers aim with your mouse (You can kill enemies now)
5. I added 3 new enemies (One shoots, one heals, one turns invisible) and a new map!
