# ShipTesting
A game I will make for english

## The Vision
You control a ship in a 2d environment destroying enemys who harm your home planet. 

This game will have a story and maybe a ending if not dev lazy. 

## Current Progress
1. I have figured out the controls for the ship!! You move forward and backward with w/s and turn left/right with a/d. 

## Things that will be added

- Enemys
- Lazer to shoot with
- A story 
- Maybe boss 


## Excepted Release date
There rlly isn't any but ig start of june 2025

## How to run code
Download the shipGame folder, and  find the ship.py file and run it. You may have to download python & pygame.

I shall create a .itch.io page once it's complete.
